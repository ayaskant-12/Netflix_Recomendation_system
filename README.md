# Netflix Recomendation System

## Data Loading and Exploration

The code starts by loading the Netflix dataset from a CSV file and performs basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

This includes checking for missing values and displaying the structure of the dataset using the head() function.

## Text Preprocessing

The "Title" column is preprocessed using various text preprocessing techniques such as lowercasing, removal of URLs, punctuation, numbers, and stopwords. 

Additionally, stemming is applied to reduce words to their root form.
